## Clone and install

To install the program on your computer use the command (or use the built-in GIT system in your IDE
environment):

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/milosz08/pm-web-panel
```

## Run with Docker (simplest, not for development)

1. Go to root directory (where file `docker-compose.yml` is located) and type:

```bash
$ docker compose up -d
```

This command should create 1 docker container:

| Container name | Port(s) | Description                   |
|----------------|---------|-------------------------------|
| pm-web-panel   | 8080    | Application (client + server) |

> NOTE: Application outgoing port can be changed inside `.env` file.

## Setup (for development)

1. Setup client:

* Go to client directory (`$ cd app-frontend`) and install all dependencies via:

```bash
$ yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

> NOTE: If you do not have yarn, install via: `npm i -g yarn`

* Run client via:

```bash
$ yarn run dev
```

2. Setup server:

* Go to server directory (`$ cd app-backend`) and type (for UNIX):

```bash
$ ./mvnw clean install
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```

or for Windows:

```bash
.\mvnw.cmd clean install
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```

Check application state via endpoint: [/actuator/health](http://localhost:8690/actuator/health). If
response show this:

```json
{
  "status": "UP"
}
```

application is running and waiting for http requests.

3. Applications (client and server) should be available at ports:

| App name              | Port(s) |
|-----------------------|---------|
| pm-web-panel (server) | 8690    |
| pm-web-panel (client) | 8691    |

## Create executable JAR file (bare-metal)

To create executable JAR file (client + server), you must type (for UNIX):

```bash
$ ./mvnw clean package
```

or for Windows:

```bash
.\mvnw.cmd clean package
```

Output JAR file will be located inside `.bin` directory. With this file you can run app in
bare-metal environment without virtualization via:

```bash
$ java \
  -Xms1024m \
  -Xmx1024m \
  -Dspring.profiles.active=prod \
  -Dserver.port=8080 \
  -jar pm-web-panel.jar
```
